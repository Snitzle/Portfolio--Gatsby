**Location: Lincoln**


### I am a detail oriented and fast learning web developer with considerable experience in front-end and ever increasing experience in backend. Leading to three years experience developing a wide range of skills and seeking a quality focussed workplace and culture where I can thrive.

As a developer I strive for continual growth and spend a considerable amount of my time both in and outside working on personal development in order to upskill and increase my versatility. 


## **EXPERIENCE**


### **Distract, **Lincoln — Web Developer


#### April 2018 - PRESENT


### As the only developer for Distract I have gained expertise in most areas of project management and the responsibilities of guiding a department. I have proven myself capable of  handling client communication, gathering requirements, building technical specifications and estimating projects in regards to both time and finance. I have then held the responsibility of leading these projects through to completion.

Technically I have been the primary decision maker for our projects, other than our bread and butter being Wordpress. I have invested in learning languages, frameworks and technologies as I saw fit for them. This has lead to creating React based analytics feeds, Node based spreadsheet processing tools, integrating modern front end tools into the development process such as SASS, Gulp and a build process to optimise assets for performance. 


### I have also managed the aftercare of our projects including server maintenance, post launch updates and introducing procedures to encourage a smoother process for patches and receiving/processing requests from our team. From spending considerable time in a marketing environment I have also absorbed skills regarding optimising sites for SEO and gained insight and a thorough understanding into the marketing process. This includes cooperating with the PR department to produce sites in a pipeline suitable to gaining the client coverage. 

During my time at Distract I have also demonstrated exemplary soft skills. I regularly take part in our podcasts, appearing on video, writing/producing social media video content and represent the company at networking events. I have also written job specifications and thus lead interviews with potential hires, providing management with insight in key hiring decisions. Being the key staff member with technical insight has also meant I have become adept at translating information that matches the recipients needs, should it be a fellow team member, bosses or clients.


### **Spiral Media, **Lincoln — Web Developer


#### September 2016 - April 2018

Whilst working at Spiral Media I was brought in as a primarily frontend developer, however during my time there I gained experience in Magento 1 and Magento 2, gradually earning responsibility and becoming responsible for whole site builds. During this period I became involved in team meetings and developed the ability to work and contribute to larger development teams.


### **Doncaster and Bassetlaw District Hospital, **Worksop — Clerical Officer


#### May 2011 - February 2016

At the hospital I worked in Medical Records and fulfilled a key role working on the emergency desk, providing the hospital with patient notes on short time scales for Accident & Emergency and urgent doctor requests. It was key that these notes were provided timely or patients in critical condition may not have been able to receive the care they required. Often this role was performed independently, leaving me responsible to manage the workload, retrieve the notes from file and liaise with the appropriate departments efficiently.

When not working on the emergency desk I had various positions throughout the Medical Records department and one summer working as a Doctors receptionists assistant, aiding with key tasks the medical staff required to be done. This included admin, contacting patients and meeting logistical needs
